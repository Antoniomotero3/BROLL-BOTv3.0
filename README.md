# BrollBot

This project provides scripts for processing video files, training a mapper model and searching for B-roll images.

## Setup

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Python 3.8+ is recommended. Some packages may require additional system dependencies such as `ffmpeg`.

## Usage

The GUI application can be started with:

Note: running the GUI requires a display environment.
